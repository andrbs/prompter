This application is a simple, locally-run tool for managing AI prompts. It's a single HTML file with JavaScript that saves prompts
 to a local JSON file.

 The interface is a table with three editable columns: "Type" (system/user), "Name" (a short name), and "Prompt". Each prompt has
 a copy icon to easily copy the text.

 To run:
 node server.js

*Node js must be installed on computer
