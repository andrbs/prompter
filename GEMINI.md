You develop simple application to manage user's AI prompts.
Application is a simple html file with Javascript, which runs locally in browser and writes prompts to a local json file.
At first step we create MVC to avaluate product.

AI prompts are displayed as a table with 3 columns:
- Type: system / user
- Name: short name of prompt 
- Prompt: ai prompt 

Minimum usability: 
- User can edit all 3 columns in simple intuitive interface
- Prompt cells have copy icon, which user uses to copy prompt
